Shop Me website(Shop me project)

A very basic shopping website, written in minimal Java code. 

Installation.

1. Please install derby and apache tomcat to run the software
2. Kindly run the createDB.sql into your derby 
3. update the connectionLinks in the DataAccess class, for each package.
4. run the software on apache tomcat.

Netbeans is perfect as it has an inbuilt apache tomcat server and easy to install derby too.
